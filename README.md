# Fetch-Data-from-a-live-source-and-Build-a-Power-BI-Dashboard
## Objective
This project aims to enhance skills in data acquisition, processing, and visualization by fetching data from a live source and creating an interactive dashboard using Power BI. The end goal is to develop a comprehensive and insightful dashboard that provides meaningful visualizations and user interactivity.

## Why This Project?
Skill Development: Improve proficiency in Python for data fetching and processing.
Data Handling: Gain experience in data cleaning and structuring to ensure high-quality data.
Visualization Expertise: Enhance abilities in creating interactive and visually appealing dashboards using Power BI.
Storytelling with Data: Learn to present data in a way that highlights key insights and engages users.
End-to-End Workflow: Understand the complete process from data acquisition to presentation.

## Project Steps
# 1. API Data Retrieval
API Selection: Choose a public API that provides data in JSON format
Data Fetching: Write a Python script to fetch data from the chosen API. Ensure a substantial amount of data is retrieved for meaningful visualizations.

# 2. Data Processing
Data Cleaning: Process the raw JSON data to clean and structure it. Handle missing values, data types, and perform necessary transformations.
Tools: Use libraries such as requests and pandas in Python for data fetching and processing.

# 3. Power BI Dashboard Creation
Visualizations: Create at least five different types of visualizations. Suggestions include:
Line chart
Bar chart
Pie chart
Map
Table
Interactivity: Add interactive elements to make the dashboard user-friendly.
Layout: Design a cohesive and visually appealing layout to ensure the dashboard tells a story and highlights key insights
